# 24K-Magic
Sydney Wilson, Abbey Allen, and Misty Conaway 

24K Magic is a website made soley for the purpose of informing the studnets at Chester County High School who plan to attend prom on what they need to know. 

Most of our Seniors and some Juniors are not at school all day due to college classes so announcements about prom are not always efficient and helpful. We thought a website you could access from evrywhere could help. 

Website: 

  We spoke to the prom committee about this idea and they thought it was a good idea. They wanted the location, time, and ticket prices for sure. They also wanted the color gold to be featured in some way to follow the prom theme of 24K Magic. We eventually chose just basic accents of black and white to go with the gold. They said they wanted some photos on the site and at least one or two of the location.
  
  We have 4 pages on the Website: Home, Caterer, Entertainment, and Ticket Prices.
