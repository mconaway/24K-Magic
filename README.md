# 24K-Magic
Sydney Wilson, Abbey Allen, and Misty Conaway 

24K Magic is a website made soley for the purpose of informing the students at Chester County High School who plan to attend prom on what they need to know. 

Most of our Seniors and some Juniors are not at school all day due to college classes so announcements about prom are not always efficient and helpful. We thought a website you could access from evrywhere could help. It can also be reused every year just updated but the pages and navigation will already be done in the future.  

Website: 

  We spoke to the prom committee about this idea and they thought it was a good idea. They wanted the location, time, and ticket prices for sure. They also wanted the color gold to be featured in some way to follow the prom theme of 24K Magic. We eventually chose just basic accents of black and white to go with the gold. They said they wanted some photos on the site and at least one or two of the location.
  
  We have 4 pages on the Website: Home, Caterer, Entertainment, and Ticket Prices.
  
  Home:
  This page has the location, data, and time. The firts picture which is the location's logo is a link to directions to the prom's location. There is also 3 pictures of the barn where prom would be held. The buttons are on every page to navigate through the site. 
    
    Ticket Prices:
    This page tells about the ticket prices, how they change after a certain date, and the ticket limit. It also featured a picture from last year's prom.
      
      Caterer: 
       It had the name of the caterer and a picture which links you to the caterer's website that features their menus. 
        
        Entertainment: 
        This page names the DJ and what he brings to the prom (photobooth). It has a picture of the DJ which links to his site.
